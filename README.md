# tshark-tcp-stream-splitter

Lua script for split big PCAP file in few little PCAP's by tcp stream id with **one** tshark run. It's **much** faster than:

``` shell
pcap="very-big-file.pcap"
mkdir -p "$pcap.parts/"
for tcp_stream in $(tshark -n -r "$pcap" -T fields -e tcp.stream | sort -un | tail -1); do
    tshark -Y "tcp.stream eq ${tcp_stream}" -r "$pcap" -w "$pcap.parts/$tcp_stream.pcap"
done
```

because you don't need to reread entire PCAP for each tcp stream.

# Usage

``` shell
tshark -X lua_script:tcp-stream-splitter.lua -X lua_script1:very-big-file.pcap -n -r very-big-file.pcap
```

Output files will be stored by pattern `$PWD/very-big-file.pcap.parts/$CLIENT_IP-$CLIENT_PORT_$SERVER_IP-$SERVER_PORT_$TCP_STREAM_ID.pcap`.

# Hints

If there's a lot concurrent tcp streams in one big PCAP you may avoid [fail with to many opened file descriptor](https://github.com/strizhechenko/tshark-tcp-stream-splitter/issues/1) by set ulimit to maximal available value:

MacOS:

```
ulimit -n 2048
```

Some linux may allow bigger value:

```
ulimit -n 4096
```

If there's a really lot of streams probably nothing will help you. You can use shell-script above (and add some "parallelism) with python/coproc) and have nice cup of coffee. If you can suggest an better solution of this problem feel free to open an issue or send pull request.

# "Benchmarks"

- tcp stream count doesn't include corrupted (not full) tcp streams.
